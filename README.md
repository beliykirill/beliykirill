# Kirill Shevchenko â€“ Frontend Developer ðŸ‘‹

Frontend Developer focused on clean architecture, performance, and user-friendly interfaces.  
I enjoy turning ideas into accessible, responsive, and polished web experiences.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects in iGaming, EdTech, mobile apps, CRM systems, Game dev, and early-stage startups - 
this gave me adaptability and a strong product sense.

Outside of tech, I recharge through hiking, training, and traveling.  
Always learning, always refining - I value simplicity, curiosity, and thoughtful execution.
