# Kirill Shevchenko â€“ Frontend Developer ðŸ‘‹

Frontend Developer with a passion for clean architecture, performance, and thoughtful user experience.  
I love turning ideas into responsive, accessible, and visually refined interfaces â€” the kind people genuinely enjoy using.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on a wide range of projects across industries like iGaming, EdTech, mobile apps, CRM systems, game development, and early-stage startups.  
This diverse background taught me to adapt quickly, stay flexible, and deliver high-quality solutions tailored to different users and business goals.

Outside of coding, I recharge through movement â€” hiking, training, and spending time outdoors help me stay focused and balanced.  
Iâ€™m always learning, always improving â€” and I believe the best products come from a mix of curiosity, simplicity, and solid execution.
